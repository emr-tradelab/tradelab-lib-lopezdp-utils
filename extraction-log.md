## Extraction Run: 2026-02-17 17:19:42

Starting López de Prado extraction workflow...
All chapters are checked in the TODO. Per the workflow:

**All chapters extracted. Nothing to do.**

Phase 1 (Pre-Production) is fully complete — all 20 AFML chapters have been extracted as v1 submodules. Chapters 21-22 were assessed and skipped (hardware-specific, no extractable Python utilities).

The next step per the project plan is **Phase 2 (Production):** Polars migration, tests, error handling, and API design. Would you like to start planning Phase 2?

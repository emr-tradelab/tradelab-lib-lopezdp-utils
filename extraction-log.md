**Chapter 6: Ensemble Methods — Complete and merged to main.**

Summary of what was extracted:

| Function | Source | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `bagging_accuracy()` | Snippet 6.1 | Theoretical majority-voting accuracy for N learners |
| `build_random_forest()` | Snippet 6.2 | Three RF configurations adapted for financial data (methods 0/1/2 with avgU sampling) |
| `bagging_classifier_factory()` | Section 6.6 | Generic BaggingClassifier wrapper for scalability |

MLAM had no new standalone algorithms for this chapter — ensemble applications to bet sizing (Ch.3), feature importance (Ch.8), and portfolio construction (Ch.16) will be covered in their respective chapters.

Next up would be **Chapter 7: Cross-Validation in Finance**.

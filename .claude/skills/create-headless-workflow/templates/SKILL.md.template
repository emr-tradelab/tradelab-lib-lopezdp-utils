# {{name}} Workflow

## Execution Mode

**FULLY AUTONOMOUS** — Execute the complete workflow end-to-end without stopping to ask for permission.

DO NOT ask before:
- Creating/merging/deleting feature branches
- Creating directories/files
- Running quality checks
- Updating TODO.md or other documentation
- Committing and pushing

Proceed directly through all steps. Only stop if encountering an unrecoverable error.

## Scope Per Session

{{unit_of_work}}

## Full Lifecycle

### 1. Setup

```
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

Read TODO.md to determine the next unit of work:
- If user specified a unit → use that
- If user said "proceed"/"continue" → find next unchecked item
- If ALL items are checked → exit with message: "All work complete. Nothing to do."

### 2. Branch

```
git checkout -b feat/{{name}}-<unit-identifier>
```

### 3. Work

{{main_steps}}

### 4. Finalize

Run quality gate:
```
{{quality_gate}}
```

Update TODO.md — mark completed items with `[x]`.

### 5. Commit

Stage only the files you created or modified (never use `git add -A`):
```
git add <specific files changed>
git commit -m "feat({{name}}): <description of unit completed>"
```

### 6. Complete

{{GIT_STRATEGY_BLOCK}}

### 7. Update Progress

Update TODO.md with final status. If all items complete, note completion.

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
{{ERROR_TABLE_ROWS}}
| Quality gate fails | Attempt auto-fix. If still fails, fix manually and retry |
| Merge conflict | Abort merge, leave feature branch intact, exit with error message |
| Nothing to do | Exit with message: "All work complete. Nothing to do." |
